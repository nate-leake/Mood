mood tracks what contributes to your moods and emotions each day.

you can log your mood whenever you feel the need to. we encourage logging at least once daily.

## what do you log about? 

you log about what matters most to you.
throughout your life, you are constantly experiencing. you can capture your experiences within what we call contexts. a context is one facet of life to focus on. this helps us dissect what exactly we are feeling. you might be feeling happy about your social life, but angry about work, while also being excited about an upcoming family event. you can log whatever you are feeling about as many or as few contexts as you need.

nood currently comes with 10 contexts by default, but you can create your own as you need.

## notable moments

you may find yourself wanting to log about an infrequent event which doesn't warrent it's own context. this is what notable moments are for. when life throws one-off events your way, you can still keep track of how you feel about that event. 

## security 

we are always striving to keep all user data secure. this starts by locking the app with a user pin or biometrics. we use Apple's encryption algorithms to encrypt all sensitive data on device. encyrption happens before it goes into cloud storage. our cloud storage has strict permission rules that help ensure only you can access your data.
